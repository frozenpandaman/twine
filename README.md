## Development environment setup

These are specific setup instructions for my MacBook Pro, running Mac OS X 10.11 (El Capitan). The original readme and setup instructions can be found at [https://github.com/tweecode/twine](https://github.com/tweecode/twine).

Notes:
 - The most recent version of py2app (0.14) is fine; we don't need 0.6.4 specifically.
 - We're not using virtualenv (as the original repo's instructions do).
 - Removed Windows stuff like the py2exe dependency and `buildexe.py` (might restore later).
 - Moved `requirements.txt` packages into steps below.

1. Install [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and run:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/frozenpandaman/twine.git
   pip install py2app
   pip install wxpython
   cd twine/
   ```

2. Run `python app.py` to launch. Build (to the `dist/` folder) with `python buildapp.py py2app`.

Something behaving weird or not working as it should (probably because you have both Twine 1.4.2 and 1.4.3-alt installed)? Try deleting the file `~/Library/Preferences/Twine Preferences`.
